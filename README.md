<h3 align="left" style="color:#6a0dad;">🛠️ Previous Highlight: Pong Tournament Web App</h3>
<p>
A full-stack web application enabling users to play real-time Pong matches either locally on the same keyboard or remotely across devices. The app supports AI opponents with adaptive gameplay and organizes multiplayer tournaments with dynamic brackets and match scheduling.

Built using modern technologies including TypeScript, Fastify (Node.js), Tailwind CSS, and WebSockets for seamless real-time communication. It features secure user authentication with hashed passwords and JWT, detailed user profiles with match history and statistics, a live chat system for player interaction, and multilingual support with a language switcher.

The entire platform is containerized using Docker, allowing easy deployment and scalability with a single command to run all services, including backend microservices and the database.
